## Welcome to the Waiting Room!
Everyone has had bad ER experiences. This web app empowers emergency room patients by providing real-time updates on their journey through the ER! 
Patients can enter their ID to access personalized information about their current phase of care, the status of requested investigations, and more. 
Beyond updates, the app offers interactive activities like hospital exploration and guided meditation to enhance the patient experience during their stay.

## Data Handling
To retrieve and transform data from the IFEM award API we use Gumloop! <br>

We use Gumloop to make various requests to the IFEM API to retrieve patient data 
and general wait time statistics. We then transform this data and create a simple JSON object 
with all the necessary info we need so our web app can access it through Gumloop's API.

You can [find our Gumloop Webflow here](https://www.gumloop.com/pipeline?workbook_id=oiBdSZrKxnr7V1JjdX5nAX)!

## Interface Design


## How It's Built
We built our web app using React and Next.js for a seamless and dynamic user experience, 
leveraging Vercel for efficient and reliable deployment. The app is hosted on our custom domain [waiting-room.biz](waiting-room.biz)
through GoDaddy, ensuring a professional and accessible online presence.
